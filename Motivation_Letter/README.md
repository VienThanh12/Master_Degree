My motivation Letter:
Dear Aalto University Admission Committee,
My name is Vien Ha. 

The first time I heard about Aalto was when I was in high school in Vietnam. Me and my friend are going to Finland for studying Bachelor's Degree. And my friend told me that he would go to Aalto. At that time I had no idea about it even about Finland. My mom decided everything for me so I just followed the steps that my mom formulated. After living and studying for 5 months in Finland, especially in Sein√§joki for a Bachelor of Automation Engineer, I realized that It was not the path I wanted. Because I have been spending for almost 4,5 years doing Competitive Programming my main language for coding is C/C++. The thing I wanted to do was coding not electricity. So I decided that at that time I had 2 options to follow. One is going for another AMK for a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Luckily I decided that I should follow my path until the end and not drop out of school. I decided to study Web Development totally by myself because of having experience for 5 years of doing Competitive Programming so It would be fast for me to learn another one. At that time I tried to commit everything on GitHub and build a lot of pet projects. In the end, I got a job offer at Nokia where I do Software Engineering. My main task at Nokia is to enhance frontend and backend sources and also do AI things. It has been such a long and hard journey for me. Luckily I still go to the end of the path. Now a new journey that I opened for me, and this time I don't want to regret it and I want to do it by myself, my choice not to follow another person anymore. I will follow my passion and dream of building software and Aalto is always my dream from the day I came to Finland. I hope this time I can catch my opportunity. 
In my bachelor's, I just had an idea is get as high a GPA as I could so that I could go for studying in Aalto. And I hope in April I can see that dream come true.
