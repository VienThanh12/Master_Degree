My motivation Letter:
Dear Aalto University Admission Committee,
My name is Vien Ha. I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Aalto University. I am convinced that this program will provide me with the skills and knowledge 
necessary to take the next step in my career.

The first time I heard about Aalto was when I was in a gifted high school in Vietnam. Me and my friend are also going to Finland for a Bachelor's Degree. My friend told me that he would go to Aalto. At that time I had no 
idea about it even about Finland. I said that I also go to Auto but actually, it is Automation engineer. I thought I would go to the same degree with my friends. I do not even know about SeAMK, my current university.  
Finland was a new thing to me at that time I didn't want to step out of my comfort zone to embrace a new country and new culture. My mom decided everything for me so I just followed the steps that my mom formulated. 
After living and studying for 5 months in Finland, especially in Sein√§joki for a Bachelor of Automation Engineer, I realized that It was not the path I wanted. Because I have been spending for almost 4,5 years doing 
Competitive Programming my main language for coding is C/C++. The thing I wanted to do also The thing I was only good at was coding not electricity. So I decided that at that time I had 2 options to follow. One is going 
to another university for a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.
Luckily I chose option 2, I will apply for a master's degree in Computer Science at a university because I think that I should follow my path until the end and not drop out of school. I decided to study Web Development 
totally by myself on the FullStack course at the University of Helsinki because of have experience for 5 years of doing Competitive Programming so It would be fast for me to learn another one. At that time I tried to 
commit everything on GitHub and build a lot of pet projects. In the end, I got a job offer at Nokia where I do Software Engineering. My main task at Nokia is to enhance frontend and backend sources and also do AI things. 
It has been such a long and hard journey for me. Luckily I still go to the end of the path. Now a new journey that I opened for me, and this time I don't want to regret it and I want to do it by myself, my choice not to 
follow another person anymore. I will follow my passion and dream of building software and Aalto is always my dream from the day I came to Finland. I hope this time I can catch my opportunity. I have been preparing for 
this time for 3 years. I am trying my best to get as high a as GPA I can and get a nice internship. In my bachelor's, I just had an idea is get as high a GPA as I could so that I could go for studying in Aalto. And I 
hope in April I can see that dream come true. 
Enough about the story, now I will talk about my self. I am studying Bachelor of Engineer in Automation Engineering at SeAMK. I got 4.9 out of 5 in GPA and 232/240 credits. I think at that time I got about 300 credits in 
total. My bachelor last 4 years but I worked very hard to keep it just in 3 years. Now I am starting to write my thesis.I planned to graduate in June next year. About my experience, I had been working as a backend 
developer in a start up company in Vietnam for more than 1 year. Now I am working as Software Engineering Intern at Nokia since May 2024. I worked in Emerging Technology Team or in officially Advanced Technology and 
Incubation (CNS). I am develongping GenerativeAI/LLM routines and architectures to provide it to R&D teams. Besieds, I also participate many other activites Junction. In the first junction, I got 25% out of 250 projects. 
I also got Silver Awards in the last round of Project Managerment Champion. I won many prize related to Competition Programming in High School. I hope that when I get to Aalto, I can participate to Aalto's Team to go to 
ICPC (Internation College Programming Contest). I saw that Aalto's Team performed very well in Nordic's ICPC. Out of that, I played football and badminton very well. I got two bronze medals from that. 

Best regards,

Vien Ha
